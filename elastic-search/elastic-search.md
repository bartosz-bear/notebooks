## ELASTIC SEARCH

The fields starting with an underscore are all meta fields of the result.

The `_source` object is the original document that was indexed.

## APACHE LUCENE

Lucence - open source library designed for collecting, indexing and searching information. It's a library engine behind Elastic Search.

## INDEXING

- library user includes sources of data (documents) as well as fields which will be indexed
- each document can potentially have a different structure

## INVERTED INDEX

- it's a database index storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a table, or in a document or a set of documents (named in contrast to a forward index, which maps from documents to content)
- the purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full-text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database
- it is the most popular data structure used in document retrieval systems, used on a large scale for example in search engines
