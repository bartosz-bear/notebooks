## `decouple` module

Decouple helps you to organize your settings so that you can change parameters without having to redeploy your app.

It also makes it easy for you to:

1. store parameters in `ini` or `.env` files
2. define comprehensive default values
3. have only one configuration module to rule all of your instances

It was originally designed for Django, but became an independent generic tool for separating settings from code.
